# Purpose

This module is an extension of the project https://github.com/DiUS/java-faker to use 
it easier in real-world application-. I wanted to use it especially on my own Pojo 
beans and using Annotation whether is possible in my JUnit tests. 

The framework is filling your Pojo, Stubs with random (clever) data provided by the 
Faker library. 

## Advantages

The main advantage of this tiny libray is to remove the boilerplate code to initialize 
your bean, fill them with random data and be ready for your tests-

## Scope

This module is offering :

- A JUnit Rule to mark your fields as Stubs to be randomized
- Some annotations to indicate how to generate your data.
